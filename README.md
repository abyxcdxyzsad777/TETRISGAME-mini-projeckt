# TETRISGAME-mini-projeckt
This is a mini project game **inspired by Tetris** â€“ the legendary puzzle game released in 1984.   The player controls falling blocks (Tetrominoes) and tries to arrange them to fill up horizontal rows.   Each completed row will disappear, granting points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
